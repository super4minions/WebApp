## Building process. 

  - Sketching.
  - Writing the code (TDD approach).
  - Fetching the index and style sheet files.
  - Uploading to *github* pages.
  
### Sketching the idea.

It's basically about integrating 3 APIs to make specific data (statistics) available in the form of charts based on the user's location.

### Writing the code.

  - **Tests file (test.js)**
  
  1. Check if function ```getlocation``` exists.
  
  2. check if ```getlocation``` returns data.
  
  3. Make sure that ```getlocation``` returns country as output.
  
  4. Check if funtion ```country``` returns countries and touches the DOM
  to make the countries option available.
  
  5. Check if funtion ```sts``` takes current location as input.
  
  6. Check if ```sts``` returns data.
  
  7. Check if function ```gcharts``` takes stats.
  
  8. Check if function ```drawcharts``` is working (fetches stats tables).
  
  9. Check if function ```drawcharts``` draws chart (updates the DOM).
  
  
  - **Source file (src.js)**
  
  ```JS
function request(url, cb) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
            var json = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
            // console.log("THis is console log", json)
            cb(undefined, json)
        } else {
            // console.log("waiting for response");
      }
    };
    xhr.open("GET", url, true);
      xhr.send();
}
```
  1. We had to use XMLHttpRequest asynchronously.  which means, we receive a callback when the data has been received and that
  lets the browser continue to work as normal while the request is being handled.
  2. Created the function ```getlocation``` and used the API "https://wtfismyip.com/json" to get users location by their IP.
  3. Created the funtion ```sts``` that gets the data we want to use from the API "http://api.population.io:80/1.0/countries".
  4. Created the funtion ```gchart``` that uses Google Visualization as its API,
  the function also includes two other functions ```comparef``` and ```drawchart```.
